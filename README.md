# Zepto--Analysis--project

Project Description:

SELECT 'This project explores, cleans, and analyzes Zepto product data to assess stock status, pricing strategies, category revenue, and discount patterns.' AS summary;

We designed a relational database using CREATE TABLE, populated it with data via INSERT, manipulated and retrieved records using SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE, structured relationships with FOREIGN KEY constraints, and optimized queries using JOIN, GROUP BY, and indexing to support reporting and analytics.‚Äù

Project Description:

In this project, we designed a fully relational database using DDL commands like CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE to define tables and relationships, then populated them with realistic sample data using INSERT. We enforced data integrity through primary and foreign key constraints and refined user access with DCL commands like GRANT and REVOKE 


To manage and analyze data, we performed CRUD operations‚Äîincluding SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE‚Äîto retrieve insights, correct anomalies, and remove outdated entries . We crafted complex reports using JOINs (inner, left, cross), aggregations (GROUP BY, COUNT, SUM), and subqueries, effectively delivering comprehensive summaries and dashboards .

To enhance performance, we implemented indexes and optimized queries for speed and accuracy . The project also included stored procedures and views to abstract business logic and reusable reporting layers‚Äîshowing advanced command usage and design maturity
